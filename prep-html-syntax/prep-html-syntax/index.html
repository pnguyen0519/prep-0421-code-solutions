  <h1 style="color: cyan;">My favorite Star Wars character is Darth Vader!</h1>
  <img src="https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/star-wars-darth-vader-movie-featured.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=960&h=500&dpr=1.5" alt="Darth Vader">
  <p style="color: green;">Darth Vader's greatest power is not in his ability to hurl heavy objects, his power
  lies in his unquestioning belief that he deserves to be the leader. That kind of power inspires people to follow, and it
  is a big part of what makes Vader so irresistible.</p>
